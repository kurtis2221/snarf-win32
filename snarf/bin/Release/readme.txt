|    Snarf Windows Port by Kurtis (2018)     |
|Original DOS version by Everett Kaser (1990)|
\============================================/

This program was written in C# 2008 Express.
The game requires .Net Framework 2.0 and DirectX to run

This is not a finished port. I was just experimenting
to test if I can replicate the game in C#.
The game can be played through.

The original shareware version is included in the
_OriginalDOS folder. You will need DOSBox to run it.
