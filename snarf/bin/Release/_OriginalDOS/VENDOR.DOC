			    Distribution information


        This is an arcade style game for the IBM PC family of compatible
        computers.

        The general idea of the game is this:  you have to run around through
        various mazes (levels) picking up treasure (rings and crowns) while
        avoiding the Snarfs.  You can shoot the Snarfs, but you only get points
        for the treasure, not for the Snarfs.  Each time you're touched by a
        Snarf, you're "tagged".  You start with a "tag count" of 50.  Each time
        you're tagged the count is decremented.  If you get tagged when the
        count is 0, the game is over.  You can get "healed" at a first-aid
        station (your tag count is pumped back up to 50).  First-aid is only
        available every two to four mazes.  The color of the top and bottom
        bars on the display change with each tag. Snarf 2.0 allows the user
	to create new levels for the game.


	Program requirements:
		IBM PC/XT/AT compatible.
		EGA or VGA compatible display adapter (with a minimum of 128K
			of RAM on the display adapter; early IBM EGA cards
			will not work).  It will NOT work on CGA, MDA, or
			Hercules display adapters.

        SNARF 2.0 is being distributed as SHAREWARE.  You may use the program

	The distribution files are:
		SNARF200.EXE	the game program
		SNARF200.DOC	the game documentation/manual
		REGISTER.DOC	a registration form that can be printed
		VENDOR.DOC	this file of general information

        The game package, which MUST include the files SNARF200.EXE (the game),
        SNARF200.DOC, and REGISTER.DOC (the registration form) may be
        freely copied and distributed.  These three files may be re-archived
        to better suit a given distribution system, but the files may not be
        modified in any other way.  No distributor may charge more than $6 for
        the distribution of this program, and that fee in no way reduces the
        shareware registration fee owed to the author by the user.

        The registered version of Snarf (which is NOT shareware and may NOT
        be distributed except by the author) contains at LEAST 20 levels and
        does NOT contain the "shareware reminder" screens at game end.

        The entire contents of the four files SNARF200.EXE, SNARF200.DOC,
        REGISTER.DOC, and VENDOR.DOC are:

                Copyright 1990 Everett Kaser. All rights reserved.

        They may not be modified in any way without the written consent of
